### What are the costs &amp; benefits of <span class="stars-inline">&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</span> Web data?

As a consumer, you can do all what you can do with <span class="stars-inline">&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</span> Web data and additionally:

- &#10004; You can link to it from any other place (on the Web or locally).
- &#10004; You can bookmark it.
- &#10004; You can reuse parts of the data.
- &#10004; You may be able to reuse existing tools and libraries, even if they only understand parts of the pattern the publisher used.
- &#9888; Understanding the structure of an RDF "Graph" of data can be more effort than tabular (Excel/CSV) or tree (XML/JSON) data.
- &#10004; You can combine the data safely with other data. URIs are a global scheme so if two things have the same URI then it's intentional, and if so that's well on its way to being 5-star data!

As a publisher &hellip;

- &#10004; You have fine-granular control over the data items and can optimise their access (load balancing, caching, etc.)
- &#10004; Other data publishers can now link into your data, promoting it to 5 star!
- &#9888; You typically invest some time slicing and dicing your data.
- &#9888; You'll need to assign URIs to data items and think about how to represent the data.
- &#9888; You need to either find existing patterns to reuse or create your own.

"Wonderful! Now it's data **in** the Web. The (most important) data items have a URI and can be shared on the Web. A native way to represent the data is using RDF, however other formats such as Atom can be converted/mapped, if required."
