### What are the costs &amp; benefits of <span class="stars-inline">&#x2605;&#x2605;</span> Web data?

As a consumer, you can do all what you can do with <span class="stars-inline">&#x2605;</span> Web data and additionally:

- &#10004; You can directly process it with proprietary software to aggregate it, perform calculations, visualise it, etc.
- &#10004; You can export it into another (structured) format.

As a publisher &hellip;

- &#10004; It's still simple to publish.

"Splendid! The data is accessible on the Web in a structured way (that is, machine-readable), however, the data is still locked-up in a document. To get the data out of the document you depend on proprietary software."
